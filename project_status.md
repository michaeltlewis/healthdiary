## 🎯 Next Development Phases

### Phase 2: AI Integration (Next Priority)
**Objective**: Add transcription and basic AI analysis

**Required Components**:
1. **Backend API Server**
   - Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI
   - JWT authentication system
   - API endpoints for audio upload and processing

2. **AI Service Integration**

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Current (Phase 1)
```
[Browser] → [EC2 Instance:80] → [Docker/Nginx] → [Static HTML+JS]
```

### Target (Phase 2)
```
[Browser] → [EC2 Instance:80] → [Docker/Nginx] → [React/API Backend]
                                                      ↓
[SQLite Database] ← [Application Server] → [OpenAI APIs]
                                        ↓
                                    [S3 Storage]
```

## 💰 Cost Analysis
- **Current Cost**: ~£0-7.50/month (Free Tier eligible t3.micro)
- **Phase 2 Cost**: ~£5-15/month (API usage + S3 storage)
- **Scaling Point**: £30/month when >10 concurrent users

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- **Current**: Let's Encrypt HTTPS/TLS, trusted SSL certificates, basic security groups
- **Phase 2**: JWT auth, encrypted S3 storage, API rate limiting
- **Future**: End-to-end encryption, GDPR compliance, audit logging

## 📋 Development Guidelines
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design for iPhone/Android primary use
- **Cost-Optimized**: Maintain £5-10/month target
- **Privacy-Focused**: EU data residency, user consent management
- **Scalable**: Clear migration path to enterprise features

## 🎨 Design Principles
- Simple, accessible interface with large touch targets
- Voice-first interaction to reduce visual strain
